# Meld
Exploratory work to meet DUNE's processing needs.

### Development notes

#### Usability

- [ ] Descriptions for available nodes (with possible lazy evaluation of configuration queries)

#### To develop

- [ ] Function registration without function names
- [ ] Product-lookup policies
- [ ] Error-detection for nodes with unassigned input ports (it this possible?)
- [ ] Creating paths (subgraphs)
- [ ] Backwards compatibility of existing art modules
